# SOS Safety Feature - User Guide

## 🚨 Emergency Safety for Your Travel

The SOS Safety feature helps protect you during cab rides by automatically detecting if your vehicle goes off the planned route and alerting your emergency contacts.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable SOS Safety
1. Open the app and go to **Settings**
2. Tap **SOS Safety** (red shield icon)
3. Follow the setup wizard

### Step 2: Create Your Safety Passwords
- **Full Password**: Stops all alerts completely (use when you're safe)
- **Stealth Password**: Silences alerts but keeps monitoring (use if threatened)

**💡 Tip**: Choose passwords you can remember under stress, but others can't guess easily.

### Step 3: Add Emergency Contacts
Add at least 2 trusted contacts who will be notified if something goes wrong:
- Family members
- Close friends  
- Trusted colleagues

### Step 4: Allow Permissions
The app needs these permissions to protect you:
- **Location**: Always (to track your route)
- **Notifications**: Allow (to alert your contacts)
- **Background**: Allow (to work when app is closed)

### Step 5: Test Your Setup
- Go to **SOS Settings** → **Test Voice Alerts**
- Try different languages if needed
- Make sure you can hear the alerts clearly

## How It Works

### 🛣️ During Your Trip
1. When you start a cab ride, the app automatically begins monitoring
2. It tracks your route using GPS
3. If the cab goes more than 500 meters off the expected route, an alert starts

### 🔊 When an Alert Triggers
1. **Voice Alert Plays**: "EMERGENCY: Route deviation detected"
2. **30-Second Countdown**: You have 30 seconds to enter a password
3. **Three Options**:
   - Enter your **Full Password** → Everything stops
   - Enter your **Stealth Password** → Alerts stop but monitoring continues silently
   - Do nothing → Emergency contacts are notified with your location

### 📱 What Your Emergency Contacts Receive
If you don't enter a password, your contacts get:
- Your current location (GPS coordinates)
- Time of the incident
- Information that you may need help
- Instructions on what to do

## Using the SOS Feature

### Starting Protection
SOS automatically starts when you begin a trip. You'll see a red shield icon showing it's active.

### During an Emergency
If you feel unsafe:
1. **Real Emergency**: Let the alert play and notify your contacts
2. **False Alarm**: Enter your full password to stop everything
3. **Being Threatened**: Enter your stealth password to silence alerts while still getting help

### Stopping Protection
Protection automatically stops when your trip ends, or you can manually stop it in the app.
